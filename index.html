      <p style= "text-align:center"> Hello! This website is to be used as a reference for training and caring for your new puppy!</p>
      <p style= "text-align:center"> Getting a new furry friend can be difficult, but with proper <em>knowledge, patience,</em> and <em>discipline</em> your new pup will be an obedient loyal companion! </p>
      <p style= "text-align:center"> There are many things to take note of when caring for a puppy. The main topics we will focus on will be:</p>
      <div class="center"> <ul>
  <li>Feeding Your Pup</li>
  <li>Housebreaking</li>
  <li>Dog Walking</li>
  </ul> </div>
    <h3 style="text-align:center"> <em>Feeding Your Pup</em> </h3>
    <p style= "text-align:left"> Feeding your puppy is very important, so it is wise to make sure you are aware of how to properly feed them in this crucial time of growth!</p>
    <p style= "text-align:left">Make sure you get "puppy food" when you are purchasing food for your new furry friend. This will ensure that an <em>adequate amount of nutrition</em> is present in the feed because puppies need a little <em>extra</em> <b>boost</b>. You might also want to consider a breed formulated food, i.e. large breed feed for pups that are classified in a larger breed and small breed feeds for smaller breed pups. This will ensure that the nutrition is balanced at a rate that is designed for the specific size of your dog breed. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left"> Weaning your puppy to solid food should not be an overnight endeavor but should ideally take place over the course of two to three weeks. First select the brand of puppy food you intend to feed. Puppies have <em>high caloric and nutritional</em> needs and so the food selected should be a high quality brand of puppy food. Talk to your veterinarian for specific recommendations but generally the best puppy foods will be a good source of <em>protein, calcium and calories.</em></p>
    <p style="text-align:left">Starting around four to six weeks of age begin introducing your puppy to puppy food by making a gruel by blending the puppy food with milk replacer. Offer the gruel three to four times a day gradually reducing the amount of milk replacee used to make the gruel. This way your puppy gradually learns to adapt to solid food and gastric upset is minimized. By around eight weeks of age your puppy should be eating solid food.</p>
    <p style= "text-align:left"> As puppies grow, they will have to have their eating regimen adjusted slightly to compensate for their growth. Below will be a table containing information on how much to feed a growing pup based on their <em>size!</em></p>
        <table>
    <tr>
        <th>Small Breed(up to 30 lbs.)</th>
        <th>Medium Breed(up to 80 lbs.)</th>
        <th>Large breed(>80lbs)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1/2 cup, <b>twice</b> a day until 6 months old</td>
        <td>1/2 cup, <b>3 times</b> a day until 8 months old</td>
        <td>1/2 cup, <b>3-4 times</b> a day until one year old</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p style="text-align:center"> It is important to remember that the smaller the breed of dog you have, the faster they mature.</p>
   <h3 style="text-align:center"><em>Housebreaking</em></h3>
   <p style="text-align:left"> First rule of successful potty training: <b>do not punish your puppy for an accident</b> or do anything to create a negative association with his/her bodily functions. Stay calm and assertive and quickly remove the puppy to the place that you want them to eliminate their waste.</p>
   <p style="text-align:left">First thing every morning, bring your puppy outside to the same general area. It is important to remain consistent throughout the process so your puppy can learn the habit.</p>
   <p style="text-align:left">Once your puppy has successfully gone outside, it is important to <em>reward</em> the good behavior. It does not have to be a big, loud celebration, but a simple quiet approval or a treat can get the message across of a job well done.</p>
   <p style="text-align:left">Contrary to popular belief, using a high squeeky voice with high energy to take your pup to the bathroom can actually be a <em>distraction</em>. The followling link will give you even more detail on how to <em>effectively</em> potty train your new puppy:</p>

   <h3 style="text-align:center"><em>Dog Walking</em></h3>
   <p style="text-align:left">Even at just a few weeks old, you can introduce your pup to his/her collar and leash. The trick is to wait until she’s doing something positive such as feeding, playing, or getting affection from you and then you can slip on the collar and leash.</p>
   <p style="text-align:left"> The idea is <em>both to get her used to wearing them and to have her associate them with positive feelings</em>. If your pup is resistant against the leash or collar, then try using treats or toys to get your pup to be more comfortable.</p>
   <p style="text-align:left">Go for a practice walk inside until you feel your pup is used to the leash and collar. </p>
   <p style="text-align:left">If you have a backyard, you should use "potty" time as another opportunity for leash training. To do so, you start by walking your pup out to the spot where you want him/her to go. Then when you are confident your pup understands not to fight the leash.  </p>
   <p style="text-align:left">Be patient; keep the first walks short. While you’re on a walk, if your puppy looks as if it's about to lunge towards something or is about to get distracted, make a sound and move a few steps away and reward his/her following you with a treat and praise.</p>
